This Power BI project analyzes road accident data to identify key trends and patterns. 
The dashboard visualizes casualties, accidents, and their severity (fatal, serious, slight) alongside factors like vehicle type, road type, light conditions (day/night), and urban/rural location. 
Key findings include a year-over-year decrease in overall casualties and accidents, with specific insights into the distribution of casualties across different vehicle types and road conditions. This analysis provides actionable insights for road safety planning and interventions.
